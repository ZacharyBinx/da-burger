Track the burgers you have eaten as well as those you haven't! Stores the names of burgers you have added and allows you to change their status or remove them entirely.

Git clone and npm install the dependencies to alter the code. Any changes should be commented thoroughly and will be reviewed by myself before any changes are pushed to the main branch.
